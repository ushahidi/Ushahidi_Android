The following are brief instructions for building on the command line using
Ant. More detailed instructions for Ant and Eclipse are available at:
https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Build+The+Android+App

1) The project depends on the libraries in the Libraries/ sub-directory. For
each of these sub-directories, run the update lib-project command, for example:

$> android update lib-project -p <directory> -t <num>

where <directory> is the path to the sub-directory of the library and <num> is
the target ID of the build target.

2) The main program is in Core/ which is also a library project. Run the same
command as above on the Core/ sub-directory.

3) The actual app build is done from one of the theme directories. The default
theme is Ushahidi. Assuming you choose to build with this theme, do the
following:

Create a sub-directory called src/ in the Themes/Ushahidi/ directory.

Run the following android update project command:

$> android update project -p <path to chosen theme> -t <num>

4) Build the app using ant from within Themes/Ushahidi/

For details on making your own themes, see README.md.
